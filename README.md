## Book Sprout

# Description

This project is adapted from the first submission for the Udacity React Nano Degree - it's an SPA created with React.js, using class-based patterns (ie not hooks). The app has two pages - the first page shows books the user has sorted into the respective categories 'Want to Read', 'Currently Reading' and 'Read'. The second page provides a search interface that makes a call to Udaacity's API, which then retrieves an array of relevant books the user can sort into the above mentioned categories.

## Important

The backend API uses a fixed set of cached search results and is limited to a particular set of search terms, which can be found in [SEARCH_TERMS.md](SEARCH_TERMS.md). That list comprises the _only_ terms that will work with the backend, so a search for Basket Weaving or Bubble Wrap won't return any results.
